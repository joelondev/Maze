# Maze Project

## 0. Walls !
In this first part, you'll have to:
  * Create a window with SDL2
  * Use raycasting to draw walls on your window !
  * You don’t need to be able to rotate the camera during the execution in this part, but you must provide a way to change the angle of the camera in your code to see if it works after recompiling it
  * The color of the walls must be different from the color of the ground/ceil
  * The map doesn’t need to be parsed from a file, but you must provide a way to modify it in your code to see if it works after recompiling it. (e.g. using an array of arrays of integers or characters).
